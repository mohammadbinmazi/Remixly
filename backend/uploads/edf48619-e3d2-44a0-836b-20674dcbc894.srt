1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
LOST IN YOUR MIND

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I wanna know

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Am I losing my mind?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Never let me go

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
IF THIS NIGHT IS NOT FOREVER

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
At least we are together

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I know I'm not alone

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I know I'm not alone

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Anywhere we're together

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The part we're still together

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I know I'm not alone

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I know I'm not alone

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I know I'm not alone

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know I'm not alone

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One conscious mind

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm right away

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wanna feel one last time

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Take a pain away

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I know I'm not alone

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I know I'm not alone

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If this night is not forever

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
At least we are together

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I know I'm not alone

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I know I'm not alone

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anywhere we're together

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The part we're still together

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know I'm not alone

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know I'm not alone

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I know I'm not alone

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I know I'm not alone

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not alone

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I know I'm not alone

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know I'm not alone

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I know I'm not alone

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know I'm not alone

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I know I'm not alone
